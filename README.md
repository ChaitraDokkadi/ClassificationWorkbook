# ClassificationWorkbook
Workbook implements Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and Random Forest classification algorithms 

## Steps to run KNN for given data in project3_dataset1.txt file:
  1. Open cmd in current folder which contains KNN.py and project3_dataset1.txt file. (Change file_name in code to change input file)
  2. Type the following command in the cmd:
		'python KNN.py'
  3. Enter nearest-neighbor K value
	e.g. 5
